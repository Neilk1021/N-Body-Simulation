# N-Body-Simulation
 A simple Gravity Simulation made using OpenGL and C++. 

 ![](https://github.com/Neilk1021/N-Body-Simulation/blob/main/ezgif-2-15c9afaf5b.gif)

## Features
* Custom Graphics engine using OpenGL.
* Integrated .shader Compiler
* Speed-dependent shading on each particle.
* VAO, VBO, IBO, & Renderer Components

## Prerequisites

[OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)

[GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)

[GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)

[GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html)

## Info
* Built using openGL. Includes custom shader compiler to convert .shader files into vertex and fragment shaders
* Uses basic linear algebra to move individual bodies across the rendered screen.
* Uses custom vector class to handle forces and speed.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository.
git clone https://github.com/Neilk1021/N-Body-Simulation.git

2. Install the prerequisites mentioned above.
3. Compile and run the code using the following commands.
4. Right-click anywhere on the screen to spawn a mass.
5. Left-click anywhere to drag the camera. 

## Program Structure 
* I used a notebook to explain the function and structure of the Graphics Engine if you wish to edit it.
